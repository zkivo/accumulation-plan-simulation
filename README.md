# Accumulation Plan Strategies
Investing regularly or market timing? Simulation in World indices.

Simulation: buying with all the accumulated salaries at each 5% drop from all-time high.

The simulation suggests that investing regularly without trying to market timing by waiting a drop of 5%, it provides better outcomes.

Example output
```
Processing file: FTSE All World Historical Price Data.csv
market timing / dca = [0.7701461502980745]
unused salaries in market timing =  29
```

Also 29 salaries were unused by waiting a drop of 5% in this simulation.
